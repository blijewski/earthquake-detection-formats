# Station Information Format Specification

## Description

StationInfo is a format designed to encode the basic information of a station
location and quality.  StationInfo uses the [JSON standard](http://www.json.org).

## Usage

StationInfo is intended for use in seismic data messaging between seismic
applications and organizations. The [StationInfoRequest](StationInfoRequest.md)
Format is intended as a method of requesting a StationInfo message.

## Output

```json
    {
      "Type"      : "StationInfo",
      "Site"      :
      {
         "Station"   : String,
         "Channel"   : String,
         "Network"   : String,
         "Location"  : String
      },
      "Latitude"      : Number,
      "Longitude"     : Number,
      "Elevation"     : Number,
      "Quality"       : Number,
      "Enable"        : Boolean,
      "UseForTeleseismic" : Boolean,
      "InformationRequestor" :
      {
         "AgencyID"  : String,
         "Author"    : String
      }
    }

## Glossary

**Required Values:**

These are the values **required** to define a StationInfo.

* Type - A string that identifies this message as a StationInfo.
* Site - An object containing the site for the station, see [Site](Site.md).
* Latitude - A decimal number that identifies the latitude of this station in degrees.
* Longitude - A decimal number that identifies the longitude of this station in degrees.
* Elevation - A decimal number that identifies the elevation of this station in meters.

**Optional Values:**

The following are supplementary values that **may or may not** be provided as

* Quality - A decimal number that indicates the quality of the station in a range between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates that the station should not be used.
* Enable - A boolean flag indicating whether use of the station is enabled or not, defaults to true.
* UseForTeleseismic - A boolean flag indicating whether to use the station for teleseismic algorithms, defaults to false.
* InformationRequestor - An object containing the source who requested the information, see [Source](Source.md).
